I just made a few modifications to make it play nicely with Kinect. go to the CreateRedist directory run the RedistMaker. Then go to the created redist directory and install. You'll also need to make sure you're OpenNI configuration XML's specify 640x480 mode. Here's the modification I made to SamplesConfig.xml in the OpenNI/Samples/Config directory so I could run the OpenNI Samples.

PrimeSense Sensor Module for OpenNI (Version 5.0.1.31 Stable version - Apr 11th 2010)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Website: www.primesense.com
Forum: http://groups.google.com/group/openni-dev
Wiki: Coming soon!

Binaries are available at:
http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles/openni-compliant-hardware-binaries/32-stable

Please use this with the OpenNI unstable branch located at:
Source:
https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI
Binaries:
http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles/openni-binaries/21-stable

Release Notes:
--------------
* At the moment, the default is to compile the code with SSE3 support (this is also true for the supplied binaries). 
  If you have a CPU without such support, please remove the sse compiler flags from the make files.
  (A good hint for this error is that you encounter an "illegal instructions" messages)
* By default, the linux kernel mounts unknown USB devices with write permissions to root only, and read-only permissions to other users.
  When not running as root, this prevents communicating with the device. To fix this issue:
  - Navigate to Platform/Linux-x86/Build
  - run 'make install-usb-rules'
  - if the device was connected, unplug and reconnect it.
  This part is done automatically by the install script, but you will need to do it manually if you choose not to use the automated install.
* The device driver contains a thread for reading from the USB device. This thread should have high priority in order to function correctly. Each process using the device driver should have the CAP_SYS_NICE capability in order to raise thread priority. Failing to have that capability, will cause a failure in setting priority, consequently causing loss of data.
* MacOSX: Only OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) with a 64-bit Intel based CPU is currently supported.
  Client/Server is not supported yet so do not attempt to access the sensor with more then one application.
  
  
Build Notes:
------------
Windows:
	Requirements:
		1) Microsoft Visual Studio 2008/2010
		   From: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb984878.aspx
		2) Python 2.6+/3.x
		   From: http://www.python.org/download/
		3) PyWin32
		   From: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/
		   Please make sure you download the version that matches your exact python version.
		4) WIX 3.5
		   From: http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/60102
		5) OpenNI v1.1.x.x
		   From: http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles	

	Optional Requirements (To build the documentation):
		1) Doxygen
		   From: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc
		2) GraphViz
		   From: http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php
		   
	Building Sensor:
		1) Go to the directory: "Platform\Win32\CreateRedist".
		   Run the script: "Redist.py".
		   This will compile and prepare the redist exe files that includes everything.
		2) Install the exe you've just made which is located in Platform\Win32\CreateRedist\Final\Output\Sensor-Win32-5.x.x.x.exe
		   The installer will also automatically register all the modules into OpenNI via the NiReg utility.
		   
		The visual studio solution is located in: Platform\Win32\Build\EngineWin32.sln.
		
		Important: Please note that even though the directory is called Win32, you can also use it to compile it for 64-bit targets (AMD64/x64).
   
Linux:
	Requirements:
		1) GCC 4.x
		   From: http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html
		   Or via apt:
		   sudo apt-get install g++
		2) Python 2.6+/3.x
		   From: http://www.python.org/download/
		   Or via apt:
		   sudo apt-get install python
		3) OpenNI v1.1.x.x
		   From: http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles
		   
	Building Sensor:
		1) Go into the directory: "Platform/Linux-x86/CreateRedist".
		   Run the script: "./RedistMaker".
		   This will compile everything and create a redist package in the "Platform/Linux-x86/Redist" directory.
		   It will also create a distribution in the "Platform/Linux-x86/CreateRedist/Final" directory.
		2) Go into the directory: "Platform/Linux-x86/Redist".
		   Run the script: "sudo ./install.sh" (needs to run as root)

  		   The install script copies key files to the following location:
		       Libs into: /usr/lib
		       Bins into: /usr/bin
		       Config files into: /usr/etc/primesense
		       USB rules into: /etc/udev/rules.d 
		       Logs will be created in: /var/log/primesense
			
		To build the package manually, you can run "make" in the "Platform\Linux-x86\Build" directory.
		
		Important: Please note that even though the directory is called Linux-x86, you can also use it to compile it for 64-bit targets and pretty much any other linux based environment.	

MacOSX:
	Requirements:
		1) Xcode 3.2.6
		   From: http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action
		   http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/Developer_Tools/xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3__final/xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3.dmg
		   Please note that you need to register as a mac developer (It's free!).		   
		2) OpenNI v1.1.x.x
		   From: http://www.openni.org/downloadfiles	
		   	   
	Building Sensor:
		1) Go into the directory: "Platform/Linux-x86/CreateRedist".
		   Run the script: "./RedistMaker".
		   This will compile everything and create a redist package in the "Platform/Linux-x86/Redist" directory.
		   It will also create a distribution in the "Platform/Linux-x86/CreateRedist/Final" directory.
		2) Go into the directory: "Platform/Linux-x86/Redist".
		   Run the script: "sudo ./install.sh" (needs to run as root)

  		   The install script copies key files to the following location:
		       Libs into: /usr/lib
		       Bins into: /usr/bin
		       Config files into: /usr/etc/primesense
		       USB rules into: /etc/udev/rules.d 
		       Logs will be created in: /var/log/primesense
			
		To build the package manually, you can run "make" in the "Platform\Linux-x86\Build" directory.
